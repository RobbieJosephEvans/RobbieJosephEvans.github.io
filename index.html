Similarly to the last stage, we programmed our site to change from a long horizontal image to a smaller square shaped size image depending on the size of the page.

        <td>In stage 6, we learned how to create a header on our site, that is apparent and "fixed" regardless of where you scroll down the site. This is an important skill that, on my site, I envision to transfer into designing a fixed footer at the bottom of the page, as specified in my proposed interfaces. With this being said, our code was problematic in the sense that the margin of white space under the header was perfect when on a large screen size, but on a smaller one, the space cut of part of the body text.</td>

        <td>In this stage, we used JavaScript to fix a problem identified in Stage 6. We learned how to change the margin under the header depending on the width size of the page (which changes which header image is used). This task was done by using an event based code, and will be useful in my site especially when developing the aesthetic specifications of my site.</td>

On my website, it important to think about screen retail space, and use it effectively as taught in this stage.</td>

I am still wrapping my head around loops in general, especially with them being different in JavaScript, it will be very helpful on my website as it is a fundamental skill in coding. On my website specifically, I'm sure loops will show up a lot, but specifically in the live changing fact section.</td>
